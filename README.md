  'text': 'Hit and miss with food quality - maybe it depends on who is cooking that day.  We were there in Dec 2016 and ordered the Walleye dinner and Gyros plate.  LOVED both - perfectly cooked and delicious.  If I had written this review then, it would be 5 stars.  However we went again last week (Jan 2017), ordered the same identical plates and were totally disappointed.  Everything was underdone.  The walleye, fries, gyro meat, pita = all undercooked and not hot. We probably should have returned it all.  Doubt if we will take a chance again.',
